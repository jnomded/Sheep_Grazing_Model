#sheep scenarios

scenario:
  H0: 2                  # grazing pressure (sheep)
  INITIAL_P_FRAC: .015   # initial biomass as fraction of K 
  DT: 0.1                # time step 
  T_MAX: 300         # max time, sim will stop at T_MAX or when P reaches 0

# when can the sheep starve
sustainability:
  MALNOURISH_FRAC: 0.75  # fraction of saturation constant below which sheep are malnourished
  freeze_on_unsustainable: true  # stop when they die

#Randomness
randomness:
  seed: 42
